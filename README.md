Want to create a 'University' styled app/program, wherein a student or teacher can login and have different functionality.  For example, there will be a courses section where a teacher will see which courses/time periods/classes they are teaching or students can check their courses and see their teacher and grades and current assignments.  There will also be a bookstore, where the students can see what books are there and purchase or rent them.  The bookstore will also have merchandise such as shirts, backpacks, pens, pencils, and other such necessities that a student would be in need of.  Potentially more to come.

Both teachers and students would have different roles.
Current roles that I have considered would be the following:(Consider changing it from teacher to employee?...)
              Teachers              |             Students
1)Teacher(basic.  No special perms.)|1)Basic(Lookup grades, classes/courses, signup for courses, GPA, basic bookstore access)
2)Dept. Head(teacher++, employee--) |2)TA(Basic + some admin access to certain class(es) or for certain teacher)
3)Advisor?(Able to lookup GPAs?)    |3)Student Teacher(Basic + Teacher-level for specific course(s)/class(es))
4)Admin level?(Employee-, admin)    |4)Bookstore employed(Basic bookstore admin access(can't add new criteria/products, but can..
5)Super/principal(highest level)    |         ...Restock products/order out of stock products and check sales and such))
6)Bookstore worker(bookstore admin) |
